*Funtional programming in Scala*, by Paul Chiusano and RÃºnar Bjarnason, has finally been [published by Manning][1] a few days ago.

I bought it quite a while ago via [Manning's Early Access Program][3][^1], and although I am only halfway through the book so far its [enthusiastic Amazon reviews][2] are well deserved: this is a great book to learn more about advanced functional programming topics. If you are using Scala and are not (yet) fully into functional programming, go read it.

[^1]: This is a great idea that more publishers should adopt: buy a book that is work in progress but may already be useful to you, get regular updates and the final version once it's done. In other words, it's a bit like a `Future[Book]` with a `peek` method, and a great way to make books on new technologies available as fast as possible :-)
