## Reinfocement learning pioneers receive Turing award

Andrew Barto and Richard Sutton[^1] [receive the 2024 Turing award](https://awards.acm.org/about/2024-turing) for their groundbreaking work on [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning).
Even with today's focus on [LLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model)s and 'generative AI', reinforcement learning plays an important role, e.g. as the 'RL' part of [RLHF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback).
I still remember how much I enjoyed their classic textbook on the subject (_Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction_) as a PhD student; it's [freely available](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html)[^2] and one of my all-time favorite computer science books.
If you would rather _watch_ something on the topic, the [AlphaGo documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y) is a nice showcase on how these ideas (combined with neural networks and _lots_ of compute power) can be successfully applied to problems [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)), a wonderful board game that was previously thought 'unsolvable'.

## SICP "100% speedrun"

On a related note _also_  concerning famous computer science textbooks, here is [a nice breakdown from 2021](https://lockywolf.wordpress.com/2021/02/08/solving-sicp/) (via [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43257963)) of the time it takes to _fully_ work through [_Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs) (by Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman), colloquially known as SICP[^3]: roughly 729 hours, or almost 20 weeks of full-time work! ðŸ¤¯
