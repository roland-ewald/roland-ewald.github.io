## Beneficentrism as 'utilitarianism light'

I stumbled upon this [interesting article](https://www.goodthoughts.blog/p/beneficentrism/) by Richard Y. Chappell[^1] (from 2022) arguing for a new and more lightweight take on [utilitarian ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism), which he coined 'Beneficentrism':

> [Beneficentrism is] just the claim that it’s really important to help others—however distant or different from us they may be.

This sounds 'obvious', but in the wake of the [FTX collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_FTX#Impact_on_effective_altruism) the criticism on related concepts such as [Effective Altruism (EA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism) is piling up (e.g., see [here](https://zeeshanaleem.substack.com/p/effective-altruism-sbf-bankman-fried-critique) or [here](https://www.persuasion.community/p/the-problem-with-effective-altruism)), and there are other philisophical problems with 'dogmatic utilitarianism', for example the [repugnant conclusion](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/repugnant-conclusion/)[^2]. 
All this risks throwing the baby out with the bath water: instead of debating the pros and cons of [longtermism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longtermism) or how seriously we should take the various [trolley problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem), Beneficentrism just puts forward a moral ground rule that is sufficiently fuzzy to avoid such problems, while still making the point that helping others --- as effectively as we can --- is important. I like this term and I also like to have a word for this concept of a non-dogmatic utilitarianism.

[^2]: TLDR: In a society with `n` people living blissful lives, utilitiarianism suggests to increase the size of the society further, starting with `n+1`, even if this slightly reduces the quality of life for the others. This argument can be re-applied until you reach a state where a society has much more members, but each of them would _almost_ be suicidal, i.e. barely preferring to keep on living. This conclusion is indeed repugnant.
