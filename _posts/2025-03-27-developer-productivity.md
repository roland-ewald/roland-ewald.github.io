Here are two interesting programming-related blogposts:

- Dan North writes [about the 'worst' programmer he knows](https://dannorth.net/the-worst-programmer/) (via [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43452649)); a thoughtful comment on the dangers of individual (instead of e.g. team-based) metrics to measure developer productivity.

- On a similar note, James Stanier discusses the 'classic question' of [whether software engineering managers should still code](https://theengineeringmanager.substack.com/p/should-managers-still-code). I like his distinction that technical team leads should be _in the code_, but not necessarily _coding_ (on a day to day basis). From my own experience, doing pair programming and code reviews can give an you at least _some_ insight into the changes of a codebase over time, so this can somewhat compensate for the fact that you're not writing much code after switching roles.
