## Fitness tracker accuracy

[Here](https://wellnesspulse.com/research/accuracy-of-fitness-trackers/) is an interesting new study on the accuracy of fitness trackers ([via HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43331048)), putting the overall accuracy across all evaluated devices at only 67%.

This is not very good (the usual suspects --- Fitbit, Apple, and Garmin --- are better at around 80% accuracy, depending on the metric) but I also agree with [this commenter's view on HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43371448): as long as you are using your fitness tracker mostly for motivation[^1] it does not really matter how accurate individual measurements are. 
It's more important that overall trends can be checked. If, for example, the step count is systematically over- or underestimated you can _still_ get much use out of tracking, because you can still check whether your new jogging schedule moves the needle as much as you think it does.[^2]

It's the measuring _itself_, and the difference you feel that is also backed up by _data_, that does most for my motivation.
