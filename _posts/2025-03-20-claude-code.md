## Claude Code seems to be the next step for 'vibe coding'

[Steve Yegge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Yegge), a programmer known for some interesting perspecitves on technology[^1] and some strong opinions on programming languages[^2] [has many positive things to say](https://x.com/Steve_Yegge/status/1898674257808515242) about Anthropic's new [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview) tool; bottom line:

> I've been using Claude Code for a couple of days, and it has been absolutely ruthless in chewing through legacy bugs in my gnarly old code base. It's like a wood chipper fueled by dollars.

If a hard-nosed veteran like Steve Yegge is sold on this, it's really worth a look.

[^2]: His [2006 rant on Java](https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html) is one of my favorites. What can I say: I do like Java and use it extensively (because of the ecosystem, the tooling, and the JVM), but he's not _wrong_ ðŸ˜… (recent Java versions addressed _some_ of his criticisms, but functions are still no 'first-class citizens', e.g. definable _outside_ of types, and this probably won't change anytime soon).
