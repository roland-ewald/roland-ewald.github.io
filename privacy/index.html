<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

I take your privacy seriously. To better protect your privacy I provide this privacy policy notice explaining the way your personal information is collected and used.


<h3>Collection of Routine Information</h3>

This website does not track information about visitors, but it is hosted by a third party (GitHub) that may track basic information about visitors. This information includes, but is not limited to, IP addresses, browser details, timestamps and referring pages. None of this information can personally identify specific users of this website..


<h3>Cookies</h3>

This website does not use cookies.


<h3>Advertisement and Other Third Parties</h3>

This website does not run ads. The website does use the <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9128668?hl=en">Google search console</a> for technical reasons (e.g. to check whether Google indexing works as intended). Any tracking that is done by third parties through their own servers (e.g. Google, if you came here via Google search) is subject to their own privacy policies. This website has no access or control over cookies, scripts and/or web beacons that may be used by third parties.


<h3>Links to Third Party Websites</h3>

I have included links on this website for your use and reference. I am not responsible for the privacy policies on these websites. You should be aware that the privacy policies of these websites may differ from my own.


<h3>Security</h3>

The security of your personal information is important to me, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While I dont' store any of your personal information, I still cannot guarantee its absolute security.


<h3>Changes To This Privacy Policy</h3>

This Privacy Policy is effective as of 25. 12. 2021 and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page. I reserve the right to update or change my Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically.
