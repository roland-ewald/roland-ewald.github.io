  abstract = {Background: Clinical diagnostics of whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing data requires geneticists to consider thousands of genetic variants for each patient. Various variant prioritization methods have been developed over the last years to aid clinicians in identifying variants that are likely disease-causing. Each time a new method is developed, its effectiveness must be evaluated and compared to other approaches based on the most recently available evaluation data. Doing so in an unbiased, systematic, and replicable manner requires significant effort.
  Results: The open-source test bench “VPMBench” automates the evaluation of variant prioritization methods. VPMBench introduces a standardized interface for prioritization methods and provides a plugin system that makes it easy to evaluate new methods. It supports different input data formats and custom output data preparation. VPMBench exploits declaratively specified information about the methods, e.g., the variants supported by the methods. Plugins may also be provided in a technology-agnostic manner via containerization.
  Conclusions: VPMBench significantly simplifies the evaluation of both custom and published variant prioritization methods. As we expect variant prioritization methods to become ever more critical with the advent of whole-genome sequencing in clinical diagnostics, such tool support is crucial to facilitate methodological research.},

                    <b>Background</b><br/>
                    Deciphering the monogenetic causes of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) is an important milestone to offer personalized care. But the plausibility of reported candidate genes in exome studies often remains unclear, which slows down progress in the field. <br/>
                    <b>Methods</b><br/>
                    We performed exome sequencing (ES) in 198 cases of NDD. Cases that remained unresolved (n=135) were re-investigated in a research setting. We established a candidate scoring system (CaSc) based on 12 different parameters reflecting variant and gene attributes as well as current literature to rank and prioritize candidate genes. <br/>
                    <b>Results</b><br/>
                    In this cohort, we identified 158 candidate variants in 148 genes with CaSc ranging from 2 to 11.7. Only considering the top 15% of candidates, 14 genes were already published or funneled into promising validation studies. <br/>
                    <b>Conclusions</b><br/>
                    We promote that in an approach of case by case re-evaluation of primarily negative ES, systematic and standardized scoring of candidate genes can and should be applied. This simple framework enables better comparison, prioritization, and communication of candidate genes within the scientific community. This would represent an enormous benefit if applied to the tens of thousands of negative ES performed in routine diagnostics worldwide and speed up deciphering the monogenetic causes of NDD.

                    Canonical WNT/beta-catenin signaling is a central pathway in embryonic  development, but it is also connected to a number of cancers and  developmental disorders. Here we apply a combined in-vitro and in-silico  approach to investigate the spatio-temporal regulation of WNT/beta-catenin  signaling during the early neural differentiation process of human  neural progenitors cells (hNPCs), which form a new prospect for  replacement therapies in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.  Experimental measurements indicate a second signal mechanism, in  addition to canonical WNT signaling, being involved in the regulation of  nuclear beta-catenin levels during the cell fate commitment phase of  neural differentiation. We find that the biphasic activation of  beta-catenin signaling observed experimentally can only be explained  through a model that combines Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and raft  dependent WNT/beta-catenin signaling. Accordingly after initiation of  differentiation endogenous ROS activates DVL in a redox-dependent manner  leading to a transient activation of down-stream beta-catenin signaling,  followed by continuous auto/paracrine WNT signaling, which crucially  depends on lipid rafts. Our simulation studies further illustrate the  elaborate spatio-temporal regulation of DVL, which, depending on its  concentration and localization, may either act as direct inducer of the  transient ROS/beta-catenin signal or as amplifier during continuous  auto-/parcrine WNT/beta-catenin signaling. In addition we provide the first  stochastic computational model of WNT/beta-catenin signaling that combines  membrane-related and intracellular processes, including lipid  rafts/receptor dynamics as well as WNT- and ROS-dependent beta-catenin activation. The model&#39;s predictive ability is demonstrated under a wide  range of varying conditions for in-vitro and in-silico reference data  sets. Our in-silico approach is realized in a multi-level rule-based  language, that facilitates the extension and modification of the model.  Thus, our results provide both new insights and means to further our  understanding of canonical WNT/beta-catenin signaling and the role of ROS  as intracellular signaling mediator.

                    The state and structure of a model may vary during a simulation and, thus, also its computational demands. Adapting simulation algorithms to these demands at runtime can therefore improve their performance. While this is a general and cross-cutting concern, only few simulation systems offer reusable support for this kind of runtime adaptation. We present a flexible and generic mechanism for the runtime adaptation of component-based simulation algorithms.Itencapsulates simulation algorithms applicable to agiven problem and employs reinforcement learning to explore the algorithms&#39; performance during a simulation run. We evaluate our approach on a modeling formalism from computational biology and on a benchmark model defined in PDEVS, thereby investigating a broad range of options for improving its learning capabilities.

                    Analyzing simulation algorithm performance is cumbersome: execute
some runs, observe a performance metric, and analyze the results.
Often, the results motivate follow-up experiments, which in turn
may lead to additional experiments, and so on. This time-consuming
and error-prone process can be automated with planning approaches
from artificial intelligence, making simulator performance analysis
more convenient and rigorous. This paper introduces ALeSiA, a prototypical
system for automatic simulator performance analysis. It is independent
of any specific simulation system and realizes a hypothesis-driven
approach to evaluate performance.

                    This paper introduces SESSL (Simulation Experiment Specification
via a Scala Layer), an embedded domain-specific language
for simulation experiments. It serves as an additional software layer
between users and simulation systems and is implemented in Scala.
SESSL supports multiple simulation systems and offers various features, e.g., for experiment design, performance analysis, result reporting, and simulation-based optimization. It supports &#39;cutting-edge&#39; experiments
by allowing to add custom code, enables a reuse of functionality
across simulation systems, and improves the reproducibility of simulation
experiments.

                    Simulation experiments involve various sub-tasks, e.g., parameter
optimization, simulation execution, or output data analysis. Many
algorithms can be applied to such tasks, but their performance depends
on the given problem. Steady-state estimation in systems biology
is a typical example for this: several estimators have been proposed, each with its own (dis-)advantages. Experimenters, therefore, must
choose from the available options, even though they may not be aware
of the consequences. To support those users, we propose a general
scheme to aggregate such algorithms to so-called synthetic problem
solvers, which exploit algorithm differences to improve overall performance.
Our approach subsumes various aggregation mechanisms, supports automatic
configuration from training data (\eg via ensemble learning or portfolio
selection), and extends the plug-in system of the open source modeling
and simulation framework James II. We show the benefits of our approach
by applying it to steady-state estimation for cell-biological models.

                    Unambiguous experiment descriptions are increasingly required for
model publication, as they contain information important for reproducing
simulation results. In the context of model composition, this information
can be used to generate experiments for the composed model. If the
original experiment descriptions specify which model property they
refer to, we can then execute the generated experiments and assess
the validity of the composed model by evaluating their results. Thereby, we move the attention to describing properties of a model&#39;s behavior
and the conditions under which these hold, i.e., its semantics. We
illuminate the potential of this concept by considering the composition
of Lotka-Volterra models. In a first prototype realized for JAMES
II, we use ML-Rules to describe and execute the Lotka-Volterra models
and SESSL for specifying the original experiments. Model properties
are described in continuous stochastic logic, and we use statistical
model checking for their evaluation. Based on this, experiments to
check whether these properties hold for the composed model are automatically
generated and executed.

                    The state of a model may strongly vary during simulation, and with
it also the simulation&#39;s computational demands. Adapting the simulation
algorithm to these demands at runtime can therefore improve the overall
performance. Although this is a general and cross-cutting concern, only few simulation systems offer re-usable support for this kind
of runtime adaptation. We present a flexible and generic mechanism
for the runtime adaptation of component-based simulation algorithms.
It encapsulates simulation algorithms applicable to a given problem
and employs reinforcement learning to explore the algorithms&#39; suitability
during a simulation run. We evaluate the approach by executing models
from two modeling formalisms used in computational biology.

                    Standardized model exchange formats give practitioners the freedom
to choose the most suitable tool and
facilitate both cross-validation and reproduction of simulation results.
On the other hand, standardization
necessarily implies a compromise between the capabilities of individual
modeling languages and a common
ground of concepts and underlying assumptions of the given application
domain. This compromise often
leads to a mismatch of expressiveness between modeling language and
exchange format, which should be
resolved automatically, e.g., by offering a transformation. We explore
the challenges of such an approach for
the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), a well-established model
format in systems biology, and
ML-Rules, a rule-based modeling language for describing cell biological
systems at multiple interrelated
levels. Our transformation approach can be extended both in terms
of the heuristics it employs and in
terms of the modeling formalisms it supports.

                    Experimenters need to configure the data collection performed during
a simulation run, as this avoids overly large output data sets and
the overhead of collecting them. Instrumentation languages address
this problem by allowing experimenters to specify the data of interest.
Such languages typically focus on a specific modeling formalism.
While this allows for a more expressive syntax, it also prohibits
their application to other formalisms. To resolve this trade-off, we propose a formalism-independent model of the instrumentation semantics
and use it as a basis for developing embedded domain-specific languages
(DSLs). Our instrumentation DSLs share common code, allow to add
formalism-specific syntax, and are easy to extend.

                    In component-based simulation systems, simulation runs are usually
executed by combinations of distinct components, each solving a particular
sub-task. If multiple components are available for a given sub-task
(e.g., different event queue implementations), a simulation system
may rely on an automatic selection mechanism, on a user decision, or --- if neither is available --- on a predefined default component.
However, deciding upon a default component for each kind of sub-task
is difficult: such a component should work well across various application
domains and various combinations with other components. Furthermore, the performance of individual components cannot be evaluated easily, since performance is typically measured for component combinations
as a whole (e.g., the execution time of a simulation run). Finally, the selection of default components should be dynamic, as new and
potentially superior components may be deployed to the system over
time. We illustrate how player rating systems for team-based games
can solve the above problems and evaluate our approach with an implementation
of the TrueSkill(tm) rating system (Herbrich et al, 2007), applied
in the context of the open-source modeling and simulation framework
JAMES II. We also show how such systems can be used to steer performance
analysis experiments for component ranking. Paper and talk slides
are available online.

                    Demographic heterogeneity, i.e. differing mortality and fertility
among subpopulations, is an important issue in stochastic demographic
forecasting. Common approaches typically use the variables age and
sex to construct subpopulations, but this might be insufficient and
induce projection error. Many studies show significant differences
in mortality and fertility among people with and without migration
background, but also among people with different level of education
or country of origin. So far, our model projects the autochthonous
population, immigrants, emigrants, and their descendant generations
with separate mortality and fertility. Hence, the subpopulations
are build with the variables age, sex, and migration status. In this
paper, we extend the model so that a forecaster can project an unlimited
number of subpopulations. Next to age, sex, and migration background, a forecaster can use other characteristics like reason of migration
or employment to construct subpopulations, and thus to increase projection
accuracy.

                    Simulation algorithms often expose various numerical parameters, e.g., to control the size of auxiliary data structures or to configure
certain heuristics. While this allows to fine-tune a simulator to
a given model, it also makes simulator configuration more complex.
For example, determining suitable default parameters from a multi-dimensional
parameter space is challenging, as these parameters shall work well
on a broad range of models. Instead of manually selecting parameter
values, the configuration space of a simulation algorithm can also
be searched automatically. We investigate how well ParamILS (Hutter
et al. 2009), an iterated local search algorithm for algorithm configuration, can be applied to simulation algorithms, and discuss its implementation
in context of the open-source modeling and simulation framework JAMES
II.

                    Setting up simulation experiments is hard, even more so as simulation
systems usually offer only custom interfaces for this task (e.g., a graphical user interface or a programming interface). This steepens
the learning curve for experimenters, who have to get accustomed
with the idiosyncrasy of each simulation system they want to experiment
with. It also makes cross-validation experiments between simulation
systems cumbersome, since the same experiment needs to be set up
for each system from scratch. In the following, we give a brief overview
of SESSL, a domain-specific language for simulation experiments.
SESSL addresses these issues by providing a common interface to set
up simulation experiments in a more declarative manner, i.e., specifying
what to do, not how to do it. Therefore, SESSL can also be used for
documenting and reproducing simulation experiments.

                    Even the most carefully configured simulation algorithm may perform
badly unless its configuration is adapted to the dynamics of the
model. To overcome this problem, we apply methods from reinforcement
learning to continuously re-configure an ML-Rules simulator at runtime.
ML-Rules is a rule-based modeling language primarily targeted at
multi-level microbiological systems. Our results show that, for models
with sufficiently diverse dynamics, an adaptation of the simulator
configuration may even outperform the best-performing non-adaptive
configuration (which is typically unknown anyhow).

                    Visual Analytics offers various interesting methods to explore high
dimensional data interactively. In this paper we investigate how
it can be applied to support experimenters and developers of simulation
software conducting simulation studies. In particular the usage and
development of approximate simulation algorithms poses several practical
problems, e.g., estimating the impact of algorithm parameters on
accuracy or detecting faulty implementations. To address some of
those problems, we present an approach that allows to relate configurations
and accuracy visually and exploratory. The approach is evaluated
by a brief case study, focusing on the accuracy of Stochastic Simulation
Algorithms.

                    Automated transformation between modeling languages is often useful, e.g., to make tools (like simulators) based on one language applicable
to models defined in other languages. However, several problems arise
when the expressive powers of the modeling languages differ. We consider
the automated transformation between models specified in the systems
biology markup language (SBML) and ML-Rules, a rule-based multilevel
modeling language. While both languages allow for modeling aspects
that cannot be expressed in its counterpart and thus prevent a complete
and fully automated transformation, it is still possible to transform
many useful classes of models. Even more models can be transformed
by relying on certain heuristics or user input.

                    To select the most suitable simulation algorithm for a given task
is often difficult. This is due to intricate interactions between
model features, implementation details, and runtime environment, which may strongly affect the overall performance. An automated selection
of simulation algorithms supports users in setting up simulation
experiments, without demanding expert knowledge on simulation. The
first part of the thesis surveys existing approaches to solve the
algorithm selection problem and discusses techniques to analyze simulation
algorithm performance. A unified categorization of existing algorithm
selection techniques is worked out, as these stem from various research
domains (e.g., finance, artificial intelligence). The second part
introduces a software framework for automatic simulation algorithm
selection and describes its constituents, as well as their integration
into the modeling and simulation framework JAMES II. The implemented
selection mechanisms are able to cope with three situations: a) no
prior knowledge is available, b) the impact of problem features on
performance is unknown, and c) a relationship between problem features
and algorithm performance can be established empirically. An experimental
evaluation of the developed methods concludes the thesis. It is shown
that an automated algorithm selection may significantly increase
the overall performance of a simulation system. Some of the presented
mechanisms also support the research on simulation methods, as they
facilitate their development and evaluation.

                    Since the publication of Gillespie&#39;s direct method, diverse methods
have been developed to improve the performance of stochastic simulation
methods and to enter the spatial realm. In this paper we discuss
a spatial tau-leaping variant (Stau) that extends the basic leap
method. Stau takes reaction and both outgoing and incoming diffusion
events into account when calculating a leap candidate. A performance
analysis shall reveal details on the achieved success in balancing
speed and accuracy in comparison to other methods. However, performance
analysis of spatial stochastic algorithms requires significant effort
--- it is crucial to choose suitable (benchmark) models and to carefully
define model and simulation setups that take problem and simulation
design spaces into account.

                    Dry-lab experimentation is increasingly used to complement wet-lab
experimentation. However, conducting dry-lab experiments is a challenging
endeavor that requires the combination of diverse techniques. JAMES
II, a plug-in based open source modeling and simulation framework, facilitates the exploitation and configuration of these techniques.
The different aspects that form an experiment are made explicit to
facilitate repeatability and reuse. Each of those influences the
performance and the quality of the simulation experiment. Common
experimentation pitfalls and current challenges are discussed along
the way.

                    An algorithm portfolio is a set of algorithms that are bundled together
for increased overall performance. While being mostly applied to
computationally hard problems so far, we investigate portfolio selection
for simulation algorithms and focus on their application to adaptive
simulation replication. Since the portfolio selection problem is
itself hard to solve, we introduce a genetic algorithm to select
the most promising portfolios from large sets of simulation algorithms.
The effectiveness of this mechanism is evaluated by data from both
a realistic performance study and a dedicated test environment.

                    Current and upcoming architectures of desktop and high performance
computers offer increasing means for parallel execution. Since the
computational demands induced by ever more realistic models increase
steadily, this trend is of growing importance for systems biology.
Simulations of these models may involve the consideration of multiple
parameter combinations, their replications, data collection, and
data analysis—all of which offer different opportunities for parallelization.
We present a brief theoretical analysis of these opportunities in
order to show their potential impact on the overall computation time.
The benefits of using more than one opportunity for parallelization
are illustrated by a set of benchmark experiments, which furthermore
show that parallelizability should be exploited in a flexible manner
to achieve speedup.

                    Predicting future populations and their structure is a central theme
in demography. It is related to public health issues, political decision-making, or urban planning. Since these predictions are concerned with the
evolution of a complex system, they exhibit a considerable uncertainty.
Accounting for this inherent uncertainty is crucial for subsequent
decision processes, as it reveals the range of possible outcomes
and their likelihood. Consequently, probabilistic prediction approaches
emerged over the past decades. This paper describes the probabilistic
population projection model (PPPM), a recently developed method that
allows detailed projections, but has a complex structure and requires
much input data. We discuss the development of P3J, a tool that helps
users in managing and executing projections and is built on top of
the simulation system JAMES II. We outline how even specific tools
like P3J profit from general-purpose simulation frameworks like JAMES
II, and illustrate its usage by a simple example.

                    The increase and diversity of simulation methods bears witness of
the need for more efficient discrete event simulations in computational
biology --- but how efficient are those methods, and how to ensure
an efficient simulation for a concrete model? As the performance
of simulation methods depends on the model, the simulator, and the
infrastructure, general answers to those questions are likely to
remain illusive; they have to be sought individually and experimentally
instead. This requires configurable implementations of many algorithms, means to define and conduct meaningful experiments on them, and mechanisms
for storing and analyzing observed performance data. In this paper, we first overview basic approaches for improving simulation performance
and illustrate the challenges when comparing different methods. We
then argue that providing all the aforementioned components in a
single tool, in our case the open source modeling and simulation
framework JAMES II, reveals many synergies in effectively pursuing
both questions. This is exemplified by presenting results of recent
studies and introducing a new component to swiftly evaluate simulator
code changes against previous experimental data.

                    Simulation replication is a necessity for all stochastic simulations.
Its efficient execution is particularly important when additional
techniques are used on top, such as optimization or sensitivity analysis.
One way to improve replication efficiency is to ensure that the best
configuration of the simulation system is used for execution. A selection
of the best configuration is possible when the number of required
replications is sufficiently high, even without any prior knowledge
on simulator performance or problem instance. We present an adaptive
replication mechanism that combines portfolio theory with reinforcement
learning: it adapts itself to the given problem instance at runtime
and can be restricted to an efficient algorithm portfolio.

                    While simulationists devise ever more efficient simulation algorithms
for specific applications and infrastructures, the problem of automatically
selecting the most appropriate one for a given problem has received
little attention so far. One reason for this is the overwhelming
amount of performance data that has to be analyzed for deriving suitable
selection mechanisms. We address this problem with a framework for
data mining on simulation performance data, which enables the evaluation
of various data mining methods in this context. Such an evaluation
is essential, as there is no best data mining algorithm for all kinds
of simulation performance data. Once an effective data mining approach
has been identified for a specific class of problems, its results
can be used to select efficient algorithms for future simulation
problems. This paper covers the components of the framework, the
integration of external tools, and the re-formulation of the algorithm
selection problem from a data mining perspective. Basic data mining
strategies for algorithm selection are outlined, and a sample algorithm
selection problem from Computational Biology is presented.

                    Simulation algorithm implementations are usually evaluated by experimental
performance analysis. To conduct such studies is a challenging and
time-consuming task, as various impact factors have to be controlled
and the resulting algorithm performance needs to be analyzed. This
problem is aggravated when it comes to comparing many alternative
implementations for a multitude of benchmark model setups. We present
an architecture that supports the automated execution of performance
evaluation experiments on several levels. Desirable benchmark model
properties are motivated, and the quasi-steady state property of
such models is exploited for simulation end time calibration, a simple
technique to save computational effort in simulator performance comparisons.
The overall mechanism is quite flexible and can be easily adapted
to the various requirements that different kinds of performance studies
impose. It is able to speed up performance experiments significantly, which is shown by a simple performance study.

                    The notion of logical processes is a widely used modeling paradigm
in parallel and distributed discrete-event simulation. Yet, the comparison
among different simulation algorithms for LP models still remains
difficult. Most simulation systems only provide a small subset of
available algorithms, which are usually selected and tuned towards
specific applications. Furthermore, many modeling and simulation
frameworks blur the boundary between model logic and simulation algorithm, which hampers the extensibility and the comparability. Based on the
general-purpose modeling and simulation framework JAMES II, which
has already been used for experiments with algorithms several times, we present an environment for the experimental analysis of simulation
algorithms for logical processes. It separates model from simulator
concepts, is extensible (in regards to the benchmark models, the
algorithms used, etc.), and facilitates a fair comparison of algorithms.

                    The notion of logical processes (LPs) is a widely used modeling paradigm
in parallel and distributed discrete-event simulation (PDES). Nevertheless
the comparison among different simulation algorithms for LP models
still remains difficult: there are too many combinations of algorithms
to be explored, often simulation systems only provide a small subset
of available algorithms, and many m\&amp;amp;s frameworks blur the boundary
between model logic and simulation algorithm, which hampers extensibility
and comparability. We present an environment for the experimental
analysis of simulation algorithms for logical processes. It separates
between model and simulator, is extensible, and facilitates a fair
comparison of algorithms. We illustrate the functioning of the environment
by presenting experimental results for well-known simulation algorithms
and a benchmark model.

                    Distributed simulation has emerged as an important instrument for
studying large-scale complex systems. Such systems inherently consist
of a large number of components, which operate in a large shared
state space interacting with it in highly dynamic and unpredictable
ways. Optimising access to the shared state space is crucial for
achieving efficient simulation executions. Data accesses may take
two forms: locating data according to a set of attribute value ranges
(range query) or locating a particular state variable from the given
identifier (ID query and update). This paper proposes two alternative
routing approaches, namely the address-based approach, which locates
data according to their address information, and the range-based
approach, whose operation is based on looking up attribute value
range information along the paths to the destinations. The two algorithms
are discussed and analysed in the context of PDES-MAS, a framework
for the distributed simulation of multi-agent systems, which uses
a hierarchical infrastructure to manage the shared state space. The
paper introduces a generic meta-simulation framework which is used
to perform a quantitative comparative analysis of the proposed algorithms
under various circumstances.

                    No simulation algorithm will deliver best performance under all circumstances, so simulation systems often offer execution alternatives to choose
from. This leads to another problem: how is the user supposed to
know which algorithm to select? The need for an automated selection
mechanism is often neglected, as many simulation systems are focused
on specific applications or modeling formalisms and therefore have
a limited number of expert users. In general-purpose simulation systems
like JAMES II, an &#39;intelligent&#39; selection mechanism could help to
increase the overall performance, especially when users have limited
knowledge of the underlying algorithms and their implementation(s)(which
is almost always the case). We describe an approach to integrate
algorithm selection methods with such systems. Its effectiveness
is illustrated in conjunction with the &#39;plug &#39;n simulate&#39; approach
of JAMES II.

                    Simulations often depend heavily on random numbers, yet the impact
of random number generators is recognized seldom. The generation
of random numbers for simulations is not trivial, as the quality
of each algorithm depends on the simulation scenario. Therefore, simulation environments for large-scale experimentation with safety-critical
models require a reliable mechanism to cope with this aspect. We
show how to address this problem by realizing a random number generation
architecture for a general-purpose simulation system. It provides
various random number generators (RNGs), probability distributions, and RNG tests. It is open to future additions, which allows the assessment
of new generators in a simulation context and the re-validation of
past simulation studies. We present a short example that illustrates
why the features of such an architecture are essential for getting
valid results.

                    Modeling and simulation frameworks for use in different application
domains, throughout the complete development process, and in different
hardware environments need to be highly scalable. For achieving an
efficient execution, different simulation algorithms and data structures
must be provided to compute a concrete model on a concrete platform
efficiently. The support of parallel simulation techniques becomes
increasingly important in this context, which is due to the growing
availability of multi-core processors and network-based computers.
This leads to more complex simulation systems that are harder to
configure correctly. We present an experimentation layer for the
modeling and simulation framework JAMES II. It greatly facilitates
the configuration and usage of the system for a user and supports
distributed optimization, on-demand observation, and various distributed
and non-distributed scenarios.

                    Stochastic simulation algorithms (SSA) are popular methods for the
simulation of chemical reaction networks, so that various enhancements
have been introduced and evaluated over the years. However, neither
theoretical analysis nor empirical comparisons of single implementations
suffice to capture the general performance of a method. This makes
choosing an appropriate algorithm very hard for anyone who is not
an expert in the field, especially if the system provides many alternative
implementations. We argue that this problem can only be solved by
thoroughly exploring the design spaces of such algorithms. This paper
presents the results of an empirical study, which subsumes several
thousand simulation runs. It aims at exploring the performance of
different SSA implementations and comparing them to an approximation
via tau-Leaping, while using different event queues and random number
generators.

                    As data and knowledge about cell-biological systems increases so does
the need for simulation tools to support a hypothesis driven wet-lab
experimentation. Discrete event simulation has received a lot of
attention lately, however, often its application is hampered by its
lack of performance. One solution are parallel, distributed approaches, however, their application is limited by the amount of parallelism
available in the model. Recent studies have shown that spatial aspects
are crucial for cell biological dynamics and they are also a promising
candidate to exploit parallelism. Promises and specific requirements
imposed by a spatial simulation of cell biological systems will be
illuminated by a parallel and distributed variant of the Next-Subvolume
Method (NSM), which augments the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm
(SSA) with spatial features, and its realization in a grid-inspired
simulation system called Aurora.

                    The application of parallel and distributed simulation techniques
is often limited by the amount of parallelism available in the model.
This holds true for large-scale cell-biological simulations, a field
that has emerged as data and knowledge concerning these systems increases
and biologists call for tools to guide wet-lab experimentation. A
promising approach to exploit parallelism in this domain is the integration
of spatial aspects, which are often crucial to a model&#39;s validity.
We describe an optimistic, parallel and distributed variant of the
Next-Subvolume Method (NSM), a method that augments the well-known
Gillespie Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) with spatial features.
We discuss requirements imposed by this application on a parallel
discrete event simulation engine to achieve efficient execution.
First results of combining NSM and the grid-inspired simulation system
Aurora are shown.

                    Spatial dynamics receive increasing attention in Systems Biology and
require suitable modeling and simulation approaches. So far, modeling
formalisms have focused on population-based approaches or place and
move individuals relative to each other in space. SpacePi extends
the [pi] calculus by time and space. [pi] processes are embedded
into a vector space and move individually. Only processes that are
sufficiently close can communicate. The operational semantics of
SpacePi defines the interplay between movement, communication, and
time-triggered events. A model describing the phototaxis of the Euglena
micro-organism is presented as a practical example. The formalism&#39;s
use and generality is discussed with respect to the modeling of molecular
biological processes like diffusion, active transportation in cell
signaling, and spatial structures.

                    Stochastic simulations may require many replications until their results
are statistically significant. Each replication corresponds to a
standalone simulation job, so that these can be computed in parallel.
This paper presents a grid-inspired approach to distribute such independent
jobsover a set of computing resources that host simulation services, all of which are managed by a central master service. Our method
is fully integrated with alternative ways of distributed simulation
in JAMES II, hides all execution details from the user, and supports
the coarse-grained parallel execution of any sequential simulator
available in JAMES II. A thorough performance analysis of the new
execution mode illustrates its efficiency.

                    Modellbildung und Simulation sind schon seit langer Zeit Bestandteil
der Entwicklung von Spielen, und auch von Game-based Learning Systemen.
Im Gegensatz zu dieser langen Tradition steht die Tatsache, dass
Forschungen in beiden Bereichen häufig parallel läuft. In Spielen
wird häufig nicht expliziert, wie welche Modelle entwickelt wurden
oder welche Simulationsalgorithmen verwendet werden. In Simulationssystemen
werden oft Testszenarien entwickelt, die spielerischen Charakter
haben, ohne das dies notwendiger Weise die Entwicklung von Game-based
Learning oder von Spielen voran bringt. Da Forschung in Modellbildung
und Simulation die Spielentwicklung voran bringen kann, und umgekehrt
Spielszenarien interessante Testumgebungen für Experimente darstellen
können, wird in diesem Papier der Ansatz gemacht, das Feld zu strukturieren.
Dabei werden die drei Bereiche Modellbildung und Simulation, Spiele
und Game-based Learning betrachtet.

                    Using modeling and simulation techniques in game development can look
back on a comparably long history, starting in the early 1970s. In
contrast to this long tradition of combining games and simulations, it is usually not made explicit which kind of simulation is used, which models are fundament of the simulation, and which role the
simulation and the models have in the game based scenario (e.g. non-player
characters, environment, engines). This has led to a situation where
research in modeling and simulation and development of games run
in parallel -- it is not clear how recent research results influence
the interwoven development of both fields. This paper will start
with an attempt to structure both fields, and to provide for a collection
of defined terms, which help to relate modeling and simulation approaches
to game development.

                    Diverse modelling formalisms are applied in Computational Biology.
Some describe the biological system in a continuous manner, others
focus on discrete-event systems, or on a combination of continuous
and discrete descriptions. Similarly, there are many simulators that
support different formalisms and execution types (e.g. sequential, parallel-distributed) of one and the same model. The latter is often
done to increase efficiency, sometimes at the cost of accuracy and
level of detail. JAMES II has been developed to support different
modelling formalisms and different simulators and their combinations.
It is based on a plug-in concept which enables developers to integrate
spatial and non-spatial modelling formalisms (e.g. Stochastic Pi, Beta Binders, DEVS, Space Pi), simulation algorithms (e.g. variants
of Gillespie&#39;s algorithms (including Tau Leaping and NSM), Space
Pi simulator, parallel Beta Binders simulator) and supporting technologies
(e.g. partitioning algorithms, data collection mechanisms, data structures, random number generators) into an existing framework. This eases
method development and result evaluation in applied modelling and
simulation as well as in modelling and simulation research.

                    With Systems Biology, a promising new application area for modeling
and simulation emerges. Today&#39;s biologists are facing huge amounts
of data delivered at different levels of detail by a multitude of
advanced experimentation techniques. The Systems Biology approach
copes with this information by cycling through phases of forming
hypothesis, constructing models, experimenting with or analyzing
these models, and validating the findings by wet-lab experiments.
A crucial point is therefore the way in which the knowledge about
a system is formalized, i.e., how a biological system is described
as this constrains the perception of the system as well as scope
of possible answers the model might provide. In this article, we
compare different discrete-event modeling formalisms (Petri Nets, Stochastic Pi-Calculus , StateCharts, and Devs) regarding their applicability
to a cell biological system of current research interest, the Wnt
signaling pathway. We then introduce the popular Gillespie algorithm, which is the foundation of many discrete-event simulators for molecular-biological
systems, and elaborate on some interesting extensions.

                    Distributed simulation can speed up the execution of models significantly.
We introduce a new simulation algorithm and present partitioning
and load balancing techniques that are tailored to the efficient
distributed execution of PDEVS. We base our elaborations on the idea
of minimizing inter-processor communication, since this is a major
bottleneck in distributed PDEVS simulation. Additionally, experimental
results are provided which compare the performance of this new approach
to alternative algorithms.

                    In computational biology there is an increasing need to combine micro
and macro views of the system of interest. Therefore, explicit means
to describe micro and macro level and the downward and upward causation
that link both are required. Multi-Level-DEVS (or ml-DEVS) supports
an explicit description of macro and micro level, information at
macro level can be accessed from micro level and vice versa, micro
models can be synchronously activated by the macro model and also
the micro models can trigger the dynamics at macro level. To link
both levels, different methods are combined, to those belong, value
coupling, synchronous activations, variable ports, and invariants.
The execution semantic of the formalism is given by an abstract simulator
and its use is illustrated based on an small extract of the Wnt pathway.

                    Distributed simulation has emerged as an important instrument for
studying large-scale complex systems. Such systems inherently consist
of a large number of components, which operate in a large shared
state space interacting with it in highly dynamic and unpredictable
ways. Optimising access to the enormous shared data is crucial for
achieving efficient simulation executions. This effort involves two
major issues, data distribution and data accessing. In this paper, we discuss the issues of modelling shared data. We have developed
a framework for distributed simulation of MAS, which uses a hierarchical
infrastructure to manage the shared data and facilitate interoperation
amongst agent simulation models. Our framework aims to reduce the
cost of accessing shared data by dynamically redistributing shared
data in the infrastructure according to the access pattern of the
agent simulation models. Data accesses may take two forms: locating
data according to a set of attribute value ranges (Range query) locating
a particular state variable from the given identifier (ID query and
update). This paper proposes two alternative routing approaches, namely the address-based approach, which locates data according to
their address information, and the range-based approach, whose operation
is based on looking up attribute value range information along the
paths to the destinations. The two algorithms are discussed an analysed
in the context of PDES-MAS, a framework for the distributed simulation
of multi-agent systems, which uses a hierarchical infrastructure
to manage the shared state space. The paper introduces a generic
meta-simulation framework which is used to perform a quantitative
comparative analysis of the proposed algorithms under various circumstances.

                    Efficiently simulating discrete-event models in a parallel and distributed
manner is a challenging endeavour. On one hand, various factors, such as hardware infrastructure or model characteristics, have to
be considered. On the other hand, there is a wide variety of algorithms
which address ubproblems of parallel and distributed simulation and
whose performance depends on the application at hand. This work illustrates
the resulting difficulties with respect to the development of parallel
and distributed simulation systems for general purposes. It is reasoned
to what extent a prior analysis could facilitate this task. Approaches
to predict the performance of parallel and distributed simulation
systems are discussed. It is argued that the simulation of such a
simulation system is a feasible approach. This claim is underpinned
by implementing SimSim, a sequential simulator to simulate parallel
and distributed simulation systems. Then, SimSim is used to develop
a load balancing algorithm for the simulation of PDEVS models. The
algorithm’s performance is analysed using SimSim. Finally, the predicted
performance is compared to the real performance of the algorithm
when running in the simulation system James II.

                    Distributed simulation is an important instrument for studying multi-agent
systems (MAS). Such large scale MAS simulations often have a large
shared state space. Moreover, the shared state and the access pattern
of agent simulations both are highly dynamic and unpredictable. Optimising
access to the shared data is crucial for achieving efficient simulation
executions. PDES-MAS is a framework for distributed simulation of
MAS, which uses a hierarchical infrastructure to manage the shared
data. In order to enable agent simulations to access distributed
shared data efficiently, this paper proposes two routing algorithms, namely the address-based routing and the range-based routing. The
paper introduces a meta-simulation approach to evaluate the characteristics
of both solutions and provides a quantitative comparative analysis
of the proposed algorithms.

                    Multi-level modeling means the description of systems at different
abstraction levels. In Systems Biology, different abstraction levels
that arise from considering parts of the system at macro (e.g., concentrations)
and parts of the system at micro (e.g., individual) level are of
particular interest. Many modelling formalisms allow the modular
and hierarchical construction of models. Those have often been inspired
by DEVS and its construction of hierarchical models via the coupling
of other models, but this type of hierarchy does still not allow
a direct description of multi-level models, as the composed model
has no behavior or state of its own. In DEVS, like in other modeling
formalisms, macro and micro models are constructured as modular entities
interacting with each other, as if they were equal sub-models. While
this approach enables the use of established formalisms, it inhibits
a clear distinction between the levels of abstraction and therefore
hampers reusability, clearness and expressiveness. To overcome these
problems, coupled DEVS models have been enriched by newly introduced
high-level models that serve as a representation of the macro-level.
Our approach is based on the rhoDEVS modelling formalism, which already
provides variables structures, ports, and multi-couplings as key
features. As an additional feature, high-level models may completely
determine their coupled model&#39;s external input and output ports and
can filter all inputs and outputs. This enables us to translate macro-
and micro-level events over multiple abstraction levels. Furthermore, this behaviour could be very useful for modeling membrane systems.
We present the realization of this approach in James II and the individual-based
simulation of the canonical Wnt-Pathway as a sample application, in which a high-level model implementing the Gillespie approach serves
as a particle collision scheduler. Similarly, a high-level model
could include differential equations, or any other approach to model
high-level properties of the system at hand. With its ability to
survey all structural activities going on at the micro-level and
to directly affect individuals by scheduling own events, the upward
and downward causation in biological systems is captured. Although
it looks as if we left DEVS far behind with this extension, it can
be shown that models based on the extended formalism are still equivalent
to basic DEVS models. Hence, the DEVS advantages, like modular composition
of models via coupling, are preserved. Our approach is feasible to
model any number of abstraction levels and can be coupled to other
DEVS extensions (including hybrid models). We hope it eases the development
of spatial biological models, including membranes, compartments and
multiple abstraction levels.

                    The simulation system James II is aimed at supporting a range of modeling
formalisms and simulation engines. The partitioning of models is
essential for distributed simulation. A suitable partition depends
on model, hardware, and simulation algorithm characteristics. Therefore, a partitioning layer has been created in James II which allows to
plug in partitioning algorithms on demand. Three different partitioning
algorithms have been implemented. In addition to the well known Kernighan-Lin
algorithm and a geometric approach, a partitioning algorithm for
hierarchically structured models has been developed whose performance
is evaluated.

                    Motivated by the requirements of molecular biological applications
we are suggesting an extension of the {D}evs formalism. {S}tarting
with dyn{D}evs a reflective variant of {D}evs which supports dynamic
behavior, composition, and interaction pattern, we develop rho-{D}evs.
{D}ynamic ports and multi-couplings are introduced whose combination
allows models to reflect significant state changes to the outside
world and enabling or disabling certain interactions at the same
time. {A}n abstract simulator describes the operational semantics
of the developed formalism, and the trp operon model illustrates
the developed ideas and concepts.

                    Modellpartitionierung, also die Zerlegung eines Modells in verschiedene
Teile, ist eine grundlegende Voraussetzung für die parallel-verteilte
Ausführung von Simulationen. Zur Unterstützung dieser Funktionalität
wird ein Framework zur Partitionierung in JAMES II integriert. Anschliessend
wird ein Partitionierungsalgorithmus für DEVS-Modelle entwickelt
und getestet.
