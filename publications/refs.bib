  abstract = {Demographic heterogeneity, i.e. differing mortality and fertility
	among subpopulations, is an important issue in stochastic demographic
	forecasting. Common approaches typically use the variables age and
	sex to construct subpopulations, but this might be insufficient and
	induce projection error. Many studies show significant differences
	in mortality and fertility among people with and without migration
	background, but also among people with different level of education
	or country of origin. So far, our model projects the autochthonous
	population, immigrants, emigrants, and their descendant generations
	with separate mortality and fertility. Hence, the subpopulations
	are build with the variables age, sex, and migration status. In this
	paper, we extend the model so that a forecaster can project an unlimited
	number of subpopulations. Next to age, sex, and migration background,
	a forecaster can use other characteristics like reason of migration
	or employment to construct subpopulations, and thus to increase projection
	accuracy.},

  abstract = {To select the most suitable simulation algorithm for a given task

	which may strongly affect the overall performance. An automated selection
	of simulation algorithms supports users in setting up simulation

	first part of the thesis surveys existing approaches to solve the
	algorithm selection problem and discusses techniques to analyze simulation

	selection techniques is worked out, as these stem from various research
	domains (e.g., finance, artificial intelligence). The second part
	introduces a software framework for automatic simulation algorithm
	selection and describes its constituents, as well as their integration

	selection mechanisms are able to cope with three situations: a) no
	prior knowledge is available, b) the impact of problem features on
	performance is unknown, and c) a relationship between problem features
	and algorithm performance can be established empirically. An experimental
	evaluation of the developed methods concludes the thesis. It is shown
	that an automated algorithm selection may significantly increase

  title = {Multi-Level Modeling with DEVS - A Critical Inspection and Steps
	Towards a Feasible Approach},
  month = dec,
  year = {2006},
  note = {Poster},
  abstract = {Multi-level modeling means the description of systems at different
	abstraction levels. In Systems Biology, different abstraction levels
	that arise from considering parts of the system at macro (e.g., concentrations)
	and parts of the system at micro (e.g., individual) level are of
	particular interest. Many modelling formalisms allow the modular
	and hierarchical construction of models. Those have often been inspired
	by DEVS and its construction of hierarchical models via the coupling
	of other models, but this type of hierarchy does still not allow
	a direct description of multi-level models, as the composed model
	has no behavior or state of its own. In DEVS, like in other modeling
	formalisms, macro and micro models are constructured as modular entities
	interacting with each other, as if they were equal sub-models. While
	this approach enables the use of established formalisms, it inhibits
	a clear distinction between the levels of abstraction and therefore
	hampers reusability, clearness and expressiveness. To overcome these
	problems, coupled DEVS models have been enriched by newly introduced
	high-level models that serve as a representation of the macro-level.
	Our approach is based on the rhoDEVS modelling formalism, which already
	provides variables structures, ports, and multi-couplings as key
	features. As an additional feature, high-level models may completely
	determine their coupled model's external input and output ports and
	can filter all inputs and outputs. This enables us to translate macro-
	and micro-level events over multiple abstraction levels. Furthermore,
	this behaviour could be very useful for modeling membrane systems.
	We present the realization of this approach in James II and the individual-based
	simulation of the canonical Wnt-Pathway as a sample application,
	in which a high-level model implementing the Gillespie approach serves
	as a particle collision scheduler. Similarly, a high-level model
	could include differential equations, or any other approach to model
	high-level properties of the system at hand. With its ability to
	survey all structural activities going on at the micro-level and
	to directly affect individuals by scheduling own events, the upward
	and downward causation in biological systems is captured. Although
	it looks as if we left DEVS far behind with this extension, it can
	be shown that models based on the extended formalism are still equivalent
	to basic DEVS models. Hence, the DEVS advantages, like modular composition
	of models via coupling, are preserved. Our approach is feasible to
	model any number of abstraction levels and can be coupled to other
	DEVS extensions (including hybrid models). We hope it eases the development
	of spatial biological models, including membranes, compartments and
	multiple abstraction levels.},

  month = {March},

  abstract = {Canonical WNT/beta-catenin signaling is a central pathway in embryonic  development, but it is also connected to a number of cancers and  developmental disorders. Here we apply a combined in-vitro and in-silico  approach to investigate the spatio-temporal regulation of WNT/beta-catenin  signaling during the early neural differentiation process of human  neural progenitors cells (hNPCs), which form a new prospect for  replacement therapies in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.  Experimental measurements indicate a second signal mechanism, in  addition to canonical WNT signaling, being involved in the regulation of  nuclear beta-catenin levels during the cell fate commitment phase of  neural differentiation. We find that the biphasic activation of  beta-catenin signaling observed experimentally can only be explained  through a model that combines Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and raft  dependent WNT/beta-catenin signaling. Accordingly after initiation of  differentiation endogenous ROS activates DVL in a redox-dependent manner  leading to a transient activation of down-stream beta-catenin signaling,  followed by continuous auto/paracrine WNT signaling, which crucially  depends on lipid rafts. Our simulation studies further illustrate the  elaborate spatio-temporal regulation of DVL, which, depending on its  concentration and localization, may either act as direct inducer of the  transient ROS/beta-catenin signal or as amplifier during continuous  auto-/parcrine WNT/beta-catenin signaling. In addition we provide the first  stochastic computational model of WNT/beta-catenin signaling that combines  membrane-related and intracellular processes, including lipid  rafts/receptor dynamics as well as WNT- and ROS-dependent beta-catenin activation. The model's predictive ability is demonstrated under a wide  range of varying conditions for in-vitro and in-silico reference data  sets. Our in-silico approach is realized in a multi-level rule-based  language, that facilitates the extension and modification of the model.  Thus, our results provide both new insights and means to further our  understanding of canonical WNT/beta-catenin signaling and the role of ROS  as intracellular signaling mediator.},

	is fully integrated with alternative ways of distributed simulation

	the coarse-grained parallel execution of any sequential simulator

	may rely on an automatic selection mechanism, on a user decision,
	or --- if neither is available --- on a predefined default component.
	However, deciding upon a default component for each kind of sub-task
	is difficult: such a component should work well across various application
	domains and various combinations with other components. Furthermore,
	the performance of individual components cannot be evaluated easily,
	since performance is typically measured for component combinations
