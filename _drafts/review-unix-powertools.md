The [Humble Bundle on Unix](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/unix-book-bundle) was too good an opportunity to pass, but I was a little on the fence regarding the age of most books, and whether they have 'aged well' or not.

I started with 'Unix Power Tools', which seemed to be one of the 'classics' and a good starting point before digging deeper. The book really does contain a treasure trove of Unix specifics, most of which are still applicable to day. 

Here are a few examples:

- Command-line shortcuts I was not aware of: `Ctrl+U` and `Ctrl+W` to delete lines and words, respectively

- Which tools are involved in the `man` pages system, and how to write one yourself (not that I plan doing that, the syntax is pretty awkward).

- How terminal emulators work and what problems they solve, on a more technical level.
